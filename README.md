# Node.js Local Development

This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools and resources to enhance the local development experience for Node.js projects. It aims to offer developers a collection of best practices, guidelines, and ready-to-use configurations to streamline their Node.js development workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iagokrt/node.js-local-development.git`
2.  Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create your coding solution using `npm run laut {name-for-the-files}`


## What  is this?
**In summary, this code automates the creation of a JavaScript file and a corresponding test file, each with a predefined template, based on user input for the desired file name. It uses the `fs` module to interact with the file system and the `path` module to handle file paths.**

These files will be created in the specified directory for us to test using the both test file and also the solution.

 - [X] ***Now, you have the flexibility to employ diverse test scenarios for code challenges on the web.***

Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

## Check out the Examples

The `/dev` directory contains the 'fo' folder, which provides some modules for reference. Here are some key details:
-   The `fn` function is exported and can be used for testing with Mocha and Chai support in the project.
-   The `rectangle.js` file exports the `rectangle` function as the default.
- The `stdin` file is a customizable input file for testing purposes.
- The string.js file is just a string ðŸ˜‚

## How to get truly started (using the test environments)

####  1Â°) First take a code challenge and use it as the name for your files

#### 2Â°) Using the LAUT Command

 1. Create your coding solutions using `npm run laut {name-for-the-files}` 

	 
	    
	- After executing this command, you will have a new file and its corresponding test file. 
	- The template for the test file can be found in the `testContent` variable within the `createFilesFromPrompt.js` file.


 2. Now, with the generated test file, you have the flexibility to effortlessly create test cases and assertions either before or after completing the problem.
 3. Finally, run tests ðŸ§ª

### Here's an example of how the initial test execution appears.


    //PS
    C:\git\node.js-local-development> npm run test

> test
> mocha --require @babel/register 'test/_tests_/*.js'
